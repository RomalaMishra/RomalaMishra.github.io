# Education

- B.Tech, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, NIT Rourkela, 2025
- Senior Secondary Education, ODM Public School, CBSE, 2021
- Secondary Education, St. Joesph's High School, ICSE, 2019

# Thesis

- Joint Haze and Sand-dust Image Restoration for Effective Object Detection and Classification
  - Undergraduate Thesis, National Institute of Technology Rourkela, 2025
  - Advisor: Dr. Sobhan Kanti Dhara

# Work experience

- Perception and Recognition via Imaging and Sensing using Modern-AI (PRISM) Research Group, NIT Rourkela, 2024-2025: Undergraduate Research Assistant

  - Advisor: [Dr. Sobhan Kanti Dhara](https://nitrkl.ac.in/FacultyStaff/FacultyProfile/dharask)
    - Developed an encoder-decoder based framework to restore image degradations caused by haze and
sand-dust for improving object detection and classification performance.
    - Incorporated selective attention mechanisms to emphasize relevant features while reducing computation.

- Machine Intelligence and Bio-motion Lab, NIT Rourkela, 2024: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  - Advisor: [Dr. Anup Nandy](https://nitrkl.ac.in/FacultyStaff/FacultyProfile/nandya)
    - Implemented a DRL-based navigation pipeline using the TD3 algorithm and laser scan inputs to enable decision-making in dynamic environments, and deployed it on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, balancing inference speed with performance constraints.
    - Developed a SLAM-based indoor navigation and exploration framework, focusing on static environments using LiDAR data and spatial mapping techniques.
    - Designed a transformer-based architecture for speech emotion recognition, combining acoustic features (pitch, tone) with transcript-based textual cues to support emotionally aware human-robot communication in multimodal settings. 

- Computer Vision Lab, IIT Kharagpur, Summer 2023: Research Intern
  - Advisor: [Prof. Aurobindo Routray](https://iitkgp.ac.in/department/EE/faculty/ee-aroutray)
    - Developed a hybrid CNNâ€“Transformer model for robust face detection and recognition in video sequences, with a focus on handling motion blur and partial occlusion.
