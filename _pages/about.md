I am currently a PhD candidate in the AeroAstro Department at MIT. My research interest lies in multi-agent robotics especially in partially observable settings with limited communication bandwidth. I am also interested in the interpretability of learning-based methods for autonomous navigation. I have combined tools like multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), graph neural networks, foundational models, and language models for my research.

My PhD thesis is on learning-based methods for multi-agent robotics focussing on:

- Scaling MARL in partially observable systems
- Long-horizon planning for multi-agent robotics
- Creating human-interpretable communication protocols for MARL methods

**I am currently on the job market for 2025**.

You can find my publications [here](https://nsidn98.github.io/publications/).

In addition to my research, I like playing musical instruments like guitar, bass, piano, drums, recorder. You can find some of my guitar videos on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nsidn98_/).
I am also into [sketching](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NsuQx0Xl9pQ5V_EsmRd8-qbaLd2zO-Gk), [astrophotography](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IXEQaMT4YNwtfmGf4ktiFaTfVXWCZLqqv2AeThw02LI/edit?usp=sharing), playing tennis, badminton, cricket and swimming.
